Session:
  Title: MSNBC.com and AngularJS
  Description:  >
    With a tagline like "Lean Forward" you can bet that MSNBC is pushing the
    limits of what a news platform can be, and its website MSNBC.com is no
    exception. That said, introducing new technologies on any Enterprise level
    site has its share of challenges. In a time when tools are often chosen for
    either their familiarity or their appeal, [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com)
    found it best to define the problems and then choose the best tools to fix
    them. In this session we will describe the technical problems encountered
    building a site of this scale, and which of those problems AngularJS became
    the perfect solution for.
