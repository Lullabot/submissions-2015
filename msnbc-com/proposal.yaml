Session:
  Title: MSNBC.com and AngularJS
  Description:  >
    With a tagline like "Lean Forward" you can bet that MSNBC is pushing the
    limits of what a news platform can be, and its website MSNBC.com is no
    exception. That said, introducing new technologies on any Enterprise level
    site has its share of challenges. In a time when tools are often chosen for
    either their familiarity or their appeal, [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com)
    found it best to define the problems and then choose the best tools to fix
    them. In this session we will describe the technical problems encountered
    building a site of this scale, and which of those problems AngularJS became
    the perfect solution for.

    Juampy started working as a web developer in 2006 after finishing his
    degree in Computer Engineering & Information Systems. He spent a few years
    developing in Ruby on Rails and Symfony before getting heavily involved
    with Drupal and it's vibrant community, where as well as writing code he
    partipates in organising events, talks at conferences and even wrote [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Drush-Users-Guide-ebook/dp/B007SVJ8MA/)!
    At Lullabot, Juampy has been working a lot outside of the Drupal-sphere,
    building decoupled sites and development workflow systems, which has given
    him a very diverse range of tools for his belt.
